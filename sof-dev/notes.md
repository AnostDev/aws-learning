# Software Development
# Introduction

Software development is a process by which standalone or individual software is created using a specific programming language. It involves writing a series of interrelated programming code, which provides the functionality of the developed software. Software development may also be called application development and software design.[12](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/16431/software-development)

# Software Development: DevOps

DevOps is a combination of **culturals philosophies**, **practices** and tools that increases the ability of an organization to deliver applications and services at high velocity: **evolving** and **improving** products at **faster** pace than an organization using traditionnal software development and infrastructure management processes.

## Continuous Integration

Continuous integration (Links to an external site.) is a DevOps software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run. Continuous integration most often refers to the build or integration stage of the software release process and entails both an automation component (e.g. a CI or build service) and a cultural component (e.g. learning to integrate frequently).

## Continuous Delivery

Continuous delivery (Links to an external site.) is a DevOps software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production. It expands upon continuous integration by deploying all code changes to a testing environment and/or a production environment after the build stage. When continuous delivery is implemented properly, developers will always have a deployment-ready build artifact that has passed through a standardized test process. 

Continuous delivery lets developers automate testing beyond just unit tests so they can verify application updates across multiple dimensions before deploying to customers. These tests may include **UI testing**, **load testing**, **integration testing**, **API reliability testing**, etc. This helps developers more thoroughly validate updates and pre-emptively discover issues. With the cloud, it is easy and cost-effective to automate the creation and replication of multiple environments for testing, which was previously difficult to do on-premises.
